# üëã Introduction

LIGHTNING SHARE is a file hosting and sharing service powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). Users can upload files under 20MB and download hosted files using a "share code" (a short 3 word code provided by [words-aas](https://words-aas.vercel.app)). After uploading a file, the file uploader can retrieve the share code and share it with others or delete the file at any time. Files will automatically be deleted after 21 days (WIP).
